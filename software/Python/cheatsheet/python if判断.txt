# if 判断
最简单的if语句:

```
if True:
	print 'Yes, it is true'
```

一个if-elif-else例子，注意最后的那句每次都会执行

```
number = 23
guess = int(raw_input('Enter an integer : '))

if guess == number:
	print 'Congratulations, you guessed it.' 
elif guess < number:
	print 'No, it is a little higher than that' 
else:
	print 'No, it is a little lower than that'
print 'Done'
# This last statement is always executed, after the if statement is executed
```
